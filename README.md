**Reduces lag as much as possible by removing everything from the page except for the game itself.**

Do you enjoy playing Tetris Friends games, yet your skill is limited by lag or a slow computer? If so, this is for you!

What this extension does is remove everything from the page except for the game itself (and the nice-looking background), set the Flash quality to "low" instead of "high", and set the "wmode" parameter to "direct". This reduces lag significantly.

All Tetris Friends are currently supported. For even greater performance, I suggest you install Adblock or Adblock Plus first.

History:

**1.0.2, 2014-10-06**
This extension used to be the "Minimal Tetris Friends" Userscript, but that website has been down for months. Bask in the glory of your favorite userscript as an easy-to-install extension instead.

**3.0.2, 2016-06-23**
Updated to use the "direct" wmode for faster rendering.

**4.0.1, 2016-03-06**
Auto resize for any browser dimensions
